# FS4500 - VidAudFramer<br />
This code works with the FuturePlus FS4500 to extract and display a Video Frame along with an Audio Frame. <br /> <br />
**When using this code:** The FS4500 Probe Manager must be open and the acquired data must be loaded into the probe manager.   <br />
**When using a stored data file:** Make sure the protocol type is correct (SST, MST DP 1.2, DP1.4) or the file will not load. <br />
**To run this app through the source code:** Install the .exe first. This will ensure that xml files are in the right place.<br /><br />
